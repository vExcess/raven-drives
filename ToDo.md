## Not Particularly Important  
    [ ] Placeholder   
## Currently In Progress
    [ ] SQL and Data sanitization    

## Important ToDos
- [ ] Add a page for users to see their open requests/offers and edit them or mark them as claimed/full

- [ ] Auto move claimed/full/expired requests/offers to a database for archival and analysis

- [ ] Unarchive requests/offers when users unmark them as claimed/full if something changes, but only allow users to do this (as well as edit) before the pickup date, so that users don't just edit the same offer over and over which would throw off our results

- [ ] encrypt sensitive data (passwords + salts)

- [ ] properly validate all input (handle sanitization and ensuring database updates can't overwrite data they shouldn't)

- [ ] make login and signup pages redirect if already signed in?

- [ ] Create MongoDB indexes to increase query performance

- [ ] Create in-memory cache for frequently queried things

## Less Important ToDos
    [ ] New Logo
    [ ] Let users put notes on their requests/offers
    [ ] Migrate to either MySQLi or SQLITE
