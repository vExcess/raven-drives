    [ ]SQL and Data sanitization - Donald
## Important ToDos
    [ ]Add a page for users to see their open requests/offers and edit them or mark them as claimed/full
    [ ]Auto move claimed/full/expired requests/offers to a database for archival and analysis
    [ ]Unarchive requests/offers when users unmark them as claimed/full if something changes, but only allow users to do this (as well as edit) before the pickup date, so that users don't just edit the same         offer over and over which would throw off our results
## Less Important ToDos
    [ ]Let users put notes on their requests/offers
    [ ]Migrate to either MySQLi or SQLITE
